# About myself

Hi, I am GoldenPig686.<br>
I have learnt a little about the grammar of Java, C# and GDScript.<br>
Addtionally, I know a little about the game engine Unity and Godot.<br>
But I have a poor knowledge of them above and I am not going to learn them further for some personal reasons.<br>
However, I am trying to learn Rust well as my home page which you can see.<br>
I hope I will master Rust and make a large number of programs with it to help others.<br>
I am only a student now, so some problems may occur in my code.<br>
Please put forward my problems directly, and I will appreciate very much.
